# Travel-Management-System
My C++ project, the Travel Management System (TMS), showcases my proficiency in various key concepts, including file handling and object-oriented programming (OOP). As a travel enthusiast and a skilled programmer, I combined my passions to create an efficient and user-friendly application for managing travel-related tasks.

The Travel Management System allows users to plan, organize, and track their travel itineraries seamlessly. Leveraging file handling techniques, I implemented robust data storage and retrieval, ensuring all travel-related information such as bookings, destinations, and expenses can be securely managed and accessed.

Utilizing OOP principles, I designed the project with modular classes, encapsulating data and functions to achieve code reusability and maintainability. The use of classes enabled me to create distinct travel components, enhancing the system's readability and flexibility.

Key Features:

User-friendly interface for smooth interaction and easy navigation.
Comprehensive storage of travel details, enabling easy retrieval and modification.
Booking management system with real-time updates and availability checks.
Budget tracker to monitor travel expenses and maintain financial control.
Customizable itineraries with the option to add, modify, or delete travel plans.
Throughout the development of the Travel Management System, I gained valuable insights into C++ best practices, including efficient memory management, error handling, and code optimization. This project honed my problem-solving skills and strengthened my ability to work on complex software solutions.

The Travel Management System exemplifies my dedication to combining my passion for travel with my programming expertise, and I look forward to applying these skills to contribute effectively as a part of a dynamic team in the software development domain.
